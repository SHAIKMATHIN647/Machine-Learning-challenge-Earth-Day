# 🌍 Earth Day ML Challenge – Carbon Footprint Estimator

This project was developed as part of the **HackerEarth Machine Learning Challenge: Earth Day Special (2025)**. The goal of the challenge was to build a machine learning model that accurately estimates the **carbon footprint of households** based on synthetic lifestyle and consumption data.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Traditional carbon footprint calculators often miss key behavioral factors. This project aims to create a **data-driven solution** that leverages energy use, diet, transportation, and waste habits to estimate carbon emissions more precisely and provide **actionable insights** for a sustainable lifestyle.

## 🧠 Approach

1. **Data Understanding & Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables
   - Performed exploratory data analysis to identify important features

2. **Modeling**
   - Tested models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost
   - Tuned hyperparameters using cross-validation

3. **Evaluation**
   - Evaluated using [insert metric, e.g., RMSE / MAE / R² score]
   - Submitted prediction file to HackerEarth for leaderboard evaluation

4. **Insights**
   - Identified top features influencing carbon output
   - Provided personalized suggestions for reduction


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost / LightGBM
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Evaluation Metric

- [Mention the evaluation metric used in the challenge, e.g., RMSE, MAE]

## 🏁 Final Result

- Submitted successfully to HackerEarth
- [23] Ranked in top 50 (if applicable)

## 🙌 Acknowledgements
